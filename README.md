# OpenSCAD-Round-Primitives
OpenSCAD can be difficult, when it comes to round edges. Furthermore, the preview of round edges seems to put a significant load on the processor.

OpenSCAD-Round-Primitives provides primitive solids with options for round edges and corners. It also provides a debug mode to save resources while modeling.
